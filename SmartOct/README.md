# Project description

Our main target was to build a smart home outlet that can be controlled from the internet, also this outlet can measure the attached devices
power consumption and log these values to the main controller. All these readings are later shown on the interface [Android, Windows].

![Real product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ELBe7ery/Home-Projects/master/SmartOct/Screenshots/11933403_1039499022735305_2092304568579028035_n.jpg)

The project used the ESP8266 and the NRF24l01 on the main controller to communicate with the user interface online and to communicate with the
rest of the house smart outlets via a RF link.

# User interface

We have implemented Windows and Android UI using C#. The Android app has a feature where the user can set names to any of the attached loades
On windows the app. will scan if the hardware is connected to the LAN, and if so the user will be allowed to enter his password to view and controll the current connected appliances

then they can be recognized via the audio commands such that the user can turn on/off any load via a voice command
