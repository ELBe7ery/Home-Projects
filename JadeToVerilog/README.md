# Script to convert Jade simulator test cases into a verilog testbench  

This script was written when i was taking MIT 6.004.2. In this course we had to build the beta processor from the gate level and simulate the
results on the jade simulator. This script was made in order to help me impleminting the BETA with Verilog HDL.

#HOW TO USE
1- Copy Jade TEST code into the TB.txt file

2- Make sure to enter your module name correctly by setting the global variable `moduleName=''`

3- In Clocked devices make sure to add the clock input in the module instance inside the TB. Ex: PC uut(.clk(CLK,....)

4- Run the code and the contents of TB.txt will be changed into the proper Verilog TB.

# Notes

In case your module failed to pass a certain testcase, the generated testbench will point you to the test case number and the cause of the error while mentioning
the expected values for all the inputs and the values generated by your module.

In case your module passes all the testcases the generated testbench will tell that you have passed all the testcases with a msg like this
