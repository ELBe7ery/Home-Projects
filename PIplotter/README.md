#A C# windows user interface to measure, plot sampled voltage

I have created during my 2nd year in the university just to watch the RC exponentialy decaying curve sampled by my arduino!. Later on
we have this tool was used during [iHub](http://ihub.asu.edu.eg) competition to measure the quality of the chargers to be used in our project.

The tool was implemented on a Tiny85 and a USB interface but then it was implemented on an Arduino.

The PCB was designed using Fritzing

#TODO
1- Enhance the microcontroller sampling code

2- Enhance the overall sampling frequency

3- Adjust the Time and voltage scale
